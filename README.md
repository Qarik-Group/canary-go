# canary-go
Canary Go App for testing Golang CI Pipelines

This is used for testing the golang-targeted binary release pipelines in [starkandwayne/pipeline-templates](https://github.com/starkandwayne/pipeline-templates).

It prints out the version passed in at compile time. That's it. Unless you're working on the above, you probably don't care about it.
